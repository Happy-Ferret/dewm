# Literate Source

This directory contains the source for this window manager, written in a
literate programming style. The .go files are autogenerated from the markdown
in this directory.

You should probably read them in the order that the `lmt` command interprets
them in, which is also the order that they were written.

1. Initialize.md - This deals with basic program initalization as a window manager
2. WindowManaging.md - This adds very rudimentary window management.
3. Keyboard.md - This adds some keystrokes to quit a program, or spawn an xterm. It implements the WM_DELETE_WINDOW ICCCM protocol.
4. MovingWindows.md - This builds on the above to add keys for moving windows
5. ResizingWindows.md - This builds on the above to add keys for resizing windows
6. ColumnManagement.md - This adds the ability to add or delete columns
7. OverrideRedirect.md - This implements the WM_TAKE_FOCUS ICCCM protocol
8. GoGenerate.md - This just adds an autogenerated warning to the files. You can probably skip it.
9. Fullscreen.md - This adds the ability to maximize/unmaximize a window with Ctrl+Alt+Enter
